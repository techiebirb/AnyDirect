# AnyDirect
A simple app that lets you redirect yourself to any url. Even scheme urls.
Useful for apps like Notion, where you can't add links to scheme/schema urls. 
This can also be used to open an app using a link. 

A website for this is being hosted already, so here is how to use it. 
1. First, get the schema url and convert it to Base64. You can use [this website](https://base64.guru/converter/encode) to convert your schema. 
2. Then, add the text to the end of this link:
    > techiebirb.pythonanywhere.com/redir/
3. Now, all you have to do is copy that link and use it!
