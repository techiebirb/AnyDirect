# AnyDirect
A simple app that lets you redirect yourself to any URL. Even scheme URLs.
Useful for apps like Notion, where you can't add links to scheme/schema URLs. 
This can also be used to open an app using a link. 

A website for this is being hosted already, so here is how to use it. 
1. First, get the schema URL and convert it to Base64. You can use [this website](https://base64.guru/converter/encode) to convert your schema. 
2. Then, add the text to the end of this link:
`techiebirb.pythonanywhere.com/redir/`
4. Now, all you have to do is copy that link and use it!

Websites to test based on operating system:

- iOS/iPadOS/Mac
